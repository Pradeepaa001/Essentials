## Description
This project is an attempt to gamify the [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). We aim to gamify all the lessons in Missing Semester.
Our game is inspired by [Oh-My-Git](https://ohmygit.org/). We wish to give the user a real terminal experience as the game Oh-My-Git does. 
Currently we are focusing on Shell and Shell Scripting.
This game is our project that we were tasked with as part of the WE Program.

## Installation
Successfully deployed into a gaming app. You can download it from our repo

## Game Engine
We are using Godot 4.0 with GDScript to develop this game.

## Project status
Currently, We have developed 5 Levels of the first game in this package.

## Areas for Exploration
- How to change the starting saving point for os.execute so that the user created and deletion files happens in the designated folder

- Alternatives.

Build on the rest of the storyline.
